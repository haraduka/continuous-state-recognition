    The state recognition of the environment and objects by robots is generally based on the judgement of the current state as a classification problem.
    On the other hand, state changes of food in cooking happen continuously and need to be captured not only at a certain time point but also continuously over time.
    In addition, the state changes of food are complex and cannot be easily described by manual programming.
    Therefore, we propose a method to recognize the continuous state changes of food for cooking robots through the spoken language using pre-trained large-scale vision-language models.
    By using models that can compute the similarity between images and texts continuously over time, we can capture the state changes of food while cooking.
    We also show that by adjusting the weighting of each text prompt based on fitting the similarity changes to a sigmoid function and then performing black-box optimization, more accurate and robust continuous state recognition can be achieved.
    We demonstrate the effectiveness and limitations of this method by performing the recognition of water boiling, butter melting, egg cooking, and onion stir-frying.

              One of the most important features of tendon-driven robots is the ease of wire arrangement and the degree of freedom it affords, enabling the construction of a body that satisfies the desired characteristics by modifying the wire arrangement.
              Various wire arrangement optimization methods have been proposed, but they have simplified the configuration by assuming that the moment arm of wires to joints are constant, or by disregarding wire arrangements that span multiple joints and include relay points.
              In this study, we formulate a more flexible wire arrangement optimization problem in which each wire is represented by a start point, multiple relay points, and an end point, and achieve the desired physical performance based on black-box optimization.
              We consider a multi-objective optimization which simultaneously takes into account both the feasible operational force space and velocity space, and discuss the optimization results obtained from various configurations.

            we propose a wire arrangement design optimization method that takes into account variable relay points.
            We perform multi-objective black-box optimization by setting the realization of target operational force and velocity spaces as objective functions.

              By increasing the number of wires, the performance becomes better.

              With the presence of gravity, the performance becomes better.
              The wire drive can produce anisotropic torque depending on the direction of joint rotation, and so gravity can be used effectively in many cases.
